# nip

To start you should type `npm install`. 

First of all, after installation you must generate your token to work with Github API:
1) Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2) Click on [Generate new token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)
3) Copy it in https://github.com/YanLobat/nip/blob/master/app/github/github.service.ts#L8

After it you can run app through `npm start`. Karma tests run through `npm test`. Protractor - through `npm run e2e`. 

P.S. I probably could have a bit more tests :grin:
